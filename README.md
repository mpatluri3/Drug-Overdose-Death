Introduction:
This dashboard takes a close look at drug overdose deaths in different regions, focusing on things like the types of drugs involved, demographic trends, and where these incidents are
happening. By analyzing these factors, the dashboard helps shed light on the substance abuse crisis and highlights areas that need more attention. This information can be really
useful for healthcare workers, policymakers, and community organizations as they work on strategies to tackle the overdose issue.

DATA/OPERATIONS:
The data for this analysis comes from National Health Statistics (CDC) on drug overdoses. It includes key metrics like death rates based on drug type and demographic details such as
age and gender. I made sure the dataset was accurate and thorough, adding extra fields to show trends over time. The data prep was straightforward, and I converted it to a CSV file 
for easy use with Tableau, which helps create a clear picture of the overdose situation.

FUTURE WORK:
In the future, Iâ€™d like to explore additional factors, such as socioeconomic influences and access to treatment, to get a fuller understanding of the overdose crisis. I also think it
would be beneficial to compare trends across different states to spot regional patterns. Plus, adding real-time data updates would keep the dashboard current and responsive to new
developments.
